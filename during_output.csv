Previously the square was known as JFK Plaza.

Robert Indiana grew up in a Christian Science Church and from his religious roots he took inspiration for his famous work of art. Despite this statue is found a bit in many squares around the world, the photo under the original written LOVE is one of those photographic souvenirs to take home!

Love Park, and the Love sign is synonymous with Philly, and is at center city near City Hall. It is such a gorgeous area and in the summer, it's also nice to sit on the side and dip your feet into the fountain. When the wind blows, the spray from the fountain blows on you and it feels amazing.

There are tons of what seem to be really nice people offering to take your photo for you, but just stand back and watch what happens after they seem to be so nice in doing so...they then demand money from the folks who just got their pic taken.

Even with the cheesy knock-off versions of the aforementioned foods, the market does offer legitimate German-made traditional Christmas items. Principal among them are the Weihnachtspyramide (Christmas pyramids with the vanes on top that spin if you light candles below), Schwibb√∂gen (hand-carved Christmas arches), and R√§uchermannl (wooden figures that appear to be smoking pipes when you burn an incense cone in their  bellies). Several of the event staff are actually German, and speak German, which is very refreshing to hear.

I can't guarantee that you will not not be unaccosted by people who make this park tbeir semi-permanent residence, but go check it out anyway; it's worth a gander. Just don't go alone at night.

The LOVE sculpture in John F. Kennedy Square is one of the favorite places to take photos, both for tourists and those who live in Philadelphia.
So famous is the statue that the square is commonly called ""LOVE Park"" and most do not know its true name.
John F. Kennedy Plaza was built in 1965 above an underground parking lot and was later expanded with the addition of beautifully curved granite steps and a majestic fountain.
The iconic Robert Indiana statue of LOVE was only installed in 1776, during the bicentennial events in 1976, but two years later it was removed. Due to its immense popularity, the sculpture returned to the plaza definitively later.
Aside from being a good place to take photos, near the sculpture is the Fairmount Park Welcome Center and a gift shop.

La ic√≥nica¬†estatua AMOR¬†de Robert Indiana fue instalada reci√©n en 1776, durante los actos del bicentenario en 1976, pero dos a√±os m√°s tarde fue removida. Debido a su inmensa popularidad, la escultura regres√≥ tiempo m√°s tarde a la plaza en forma definitiva.
