It is such a gorgeous area and in the summer, it's also nice to sit on the side and dip your feet into the fountain. When the wind blows, the spray from the fountain blows on you and it feels amazing.\n\nThere are tons of what seem to be really nice people offering to take your photo for you, but just stand back and watch what happens after they seem to be so nice in doing so...they then demand money from the folks who just got their pic taken.

I can't guarantee that you will not not be unaccosted by people who make this park tbeir semi-permanent residence, but go check it out anyway; it's worth a gander. Just don't go alone at night.

Just bring a few friends along, and you should have a fine time. :-)\n\nAlso, it's fun to go around the corner, & visot the giant clothes-pin.
