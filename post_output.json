They have a small and cute Christmas Market in December and used to have a great fountain space in the summer. The construction is finally done at this place and tourists can enjoy a good view of the city. I wish there were more plants in this park, because it would add to the aesthetic and environmental value of this place. Besides getting a photo at the LOVE statue, there is nothing else to do here.

Their efforts trying to keep the homeless away in the end makes it feel like no one is invited to stay more than 5 minutes. The LOVE statueisn't even the most prominent part of the park now.

However,  it was a sad eye opener seeing the dark side of the realities of the streets as we gave out socks and gloves. The mentally and physically challenged, the homeless, the hungry and those clothed with unclean clothes that barely fit to keep them warm from the elements. All in the mist of this deadly pandemic with no mask on. All allegedly ,put out on the street from the shelters with no assigned destination, just wandering about til it's time to return to the place where some of them call home.\nMay each of us be filled with Gratitude for the little or much that we do have.

The park was nicknamed LOVE Park for its reproduction of the 1970 Robert Robert LOVE sculpture, overlooking the square.\nFormer Philadelphia city planner Edmund Bacon and architect Vincent G. Kling planned and designed the original LOVE Park. The park is in front of the Philadelphia City Hall.\nThe park was built in 1965 over an underground garage and dedicated in 1967 as John F. Kennedy Plaza, in honor of President John F. Kennedy.\nFrom 2016 to 2018, a major reconstruction project converted the large square into a predominantly green area containing large and small lawns for casual use, two gardens with native plantings, an open lookout point by the City Hall and the Benjamin Franklin Parkway, new seats and lanes and public restrooms. A redesigned fountain features a monumental jet and a smaller jet basket with programmable lighting within a large paved oval open space.\n\n(Original)\nLOVE Park, oficialmente conhecido como John F.

People came from all over the world to skate and watch skateboarding at love park. But thanks to Philadelphia politicians, rich folk who say their tax dollars went to the awful Paines skatepark(you know, the people who pay lower taxes because of their high income),  former mayor Michael Nutter, and a whole other bunch of worthless people. What they turned this place into has made me want to move out of Philadelphia for 5 years now. I really hope people understand how bad this was to a lot of people. Everyone stresses social issues, this is one that should be addressed. It was a place where friends of all colors and backgrounds came together to enjoy a common activity. I could rant and express more anger in this review but I want people to know, from me, who has spent 100,000+ hours skateboarding in what used to be love park, that this is a social tragedy. Personally it took a large piece of my life away for nothing. The current state of the park is dull, full of trash, and all the other undesirable things skateboarding used to regulate. But what do oblivious politicians know from their comfy offices. Nothing. They know nothing. They are nothing and I hope that one day when their time comes like everyone else, they were nothing. If any billionaire wants to put this place back together I will do all the labor myself. That would be one of the best philanthropic moves a rich person could do. Unlike charities and all that kind of donation, this would actually help people. I dare one of you billionaires to restore love park. I'm calling you all out now. I dare you.
