It is such a gorgeous area and in the summer, it's also nice to sit on the side and dip your feet into the fountain. When the wind blows, the spray from the fountain blows on you and it feels amazing.\n\nThere are tons of what seem to be really nice people offering to take your photo for you, but just stand back and watch what happens after they seem to be so nice in doing so...they then demand money from the folks who just got their pic taken. Don't ask, or agree for strangers to take your pic. They want money. Take your own, it's cuter that way anyway!\n\nIt can be a sketchy place at night, so be sure to stick with the daytime visiting."

It was a very pleasant time, with McDonald's-ified versions of many international treats like traditionallike french cr\u00eapes,  authentish d\u00f6ner kebabs, reheated belgee-I-wish-the-employee-working-the-stand-gave-a-flying-fig-an waffles (AKA liege-ish waffles), and hot $5 cocoa to wash it all down.\n\nEven with the cheesy knock-off versions of the aforementioned foods, the market does offer legitimate German-made traditional Christmas items. Principal among them are the Weihnachtspyramide (Christmas pyramids with the vanes on top that spin if you light candles below), Schwibb\u00f6gen (hand-carved Christmas arches), and R\u00e4uchermannl (wooden figures that appear to be smoking pipes when you burn an incense cone in their  bellies). Several of the event staff are actually German, and speak German, which is very refreshing to hear.\n\nThe park itself has undergone significant renovation, including removal of the fountain. I can't guarantee that you will not not be unaccosted by people who make this park tbeir semi-permanent residence, but go check it out anyway; it's worth a gander. Just don't go alone at night. It can get a wee bit less than comfortable if you're not used to dealing with the kids of folks you find out on the streets at times of day or  night, when those who are fortunate have homes are aldeady inside, battened down for the night. Just bring a few friends along, and you should have a fine time. :-)\n\nAlso, it's fun to go around the corner, & visot the giant clothes-pin. And don't drive, there's practically nowhere to park close by, unless you want to pay..."

Due to its immense popularity, the sculpture returned to the plaza definitively later.\nAside from being a good place to take photos, near the sculpture is the Fairmount Park Welcome Center and a gift shop.\n\n(Original)\nUn parque precioso en medio de la ciudad.
