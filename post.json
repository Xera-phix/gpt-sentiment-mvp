They have a small and cute Christmas Market in December and used to have a great fountain space in the summer. The construction is finally done at this place and tourists can enjoy a good view of the city. I wish there were more plants in this park, because it would add to the aesthetic and environmental value of this place. Besides getting a photo at the LOVE statue, there is nothing else to do here.

The fountain is rarely on due to faulty design. There is no shade at all so you are in direct sunlight. There are barely any comfortable places to sit. Their efforts trying to keep the homeless away in the end makes it feel like no one is invited to stay more than 5 minutes. The LOVE statueisn't even the most prominent part of the park now. Instead there is a huge parking lot sign, CAR PARK, that is next to it sticks out like a sore thumb.\n\nOverall visit it in late November and December when it actually becomes a location to visit"

    "text":"They spent so much money remodeling this park as well as redoing the Love Park sign. But the truth of the matter is this park is so disgusting. You can't sit on the walls because everywhere smells like urine and there are a lot of homeless people taking up the spots to sit and enjoy people watching on a beautiful day. if you ask me the money they put into that Park was a waste of money and it could have been used for the schools or something to give back to philadelphians. Because the city failed on Love Park."

Garden with reindeers, ferris wheel $4, train $3,  carousel $3(free coloring book at this ride), parents if your taking child on you must also buy a ticket. Rides are at city hall. Tons of vendors at both love park and City Hall. Bring cash as yes people take card but lots of places are cash only.  You can park across street for $10 bucks after 5pm. Photo Op with Santa for $20 smackers but he's a great Santa.  New boot mug this year and only $5, can try wine and shots at some vendors. Plus you walk to Macy's during your visit just a few blocks away."

The port-o-potties were disgusting and made me glad I am a man and only had to pee. Every toilet seat was covered in pee and good luck finding one with toilet paper in it. With having a place attracting a lot of tourists it makes a person want to make sure they don't ever come back without bringing their own toilet paper. When I think of things that I don't want to have to worry about bringing with me when I leave the house, toilet paper is at the top of the list. The big tree was nice and the giant present made of lights was nice but not nice enough to make me ever want to go back again \ud83d\ude14"

Coming from the west coast I was under the impression, so many say, that the west coast cities have a homeless issue... Well judging by how many brothers and sisters I saw homeless at the park, maybe people only notice homeless white people then (at least the west coast homeless). It saddens me to see people in such dire straights, laying on cardboard placed atop the grating so the subterranean heat source can keep them warm enough to sleep. Not just a left coast thing...

It was exciting to hear the sounds of music that filtered the air and to see the lights at the Christmas Village, and the look of joy and hope on the faces of the merchants, the very young and the seniors from so many diverse groups of people. However,  it was a sad eye opener seeing the dark side of the realities of the streets as we gave out socks and gloves. The mentally and physically challenged, the homeless, the hungry and those clothed with unclean clothes that barely fit to keep them warm from the elements. All in the mist of this deadly pandemic with no mask on. All allegedly ,put out on the street from the shelters with no assigned destination, just wandering about til it's time to return to the place where some of them call home.\nMay each of us be filled with Gratitude for the little or much that we do have. Be Blessed and Be a Blessing to some one in need even in these trying times. For your little is much to those that have not, in Jesus name"

The park was nicknamed LOVE Park for its reproduction of the 1970 Robert Robert LOVE sculpture, overlooking the square.\nFormer Philadelphia city planner Edmund Bacon and architect Vincent G. Kling planned and designed the original LOVE Park. The park is in front of the Philadelphia City Hall.\nThe park was built in 1965 over an underground garage and dedicated in 1967 as John F. Kennedy Plaza, in honor of President John F. Kennedy.\nFrom 2016 to 2018, a major reconstruction project converted the large square into a predominantly green area containing large and small lawns for casual use, two gardens with native plantings, an open lookout point by the City Hall and the Benjamin Franklin Parkway, new seats and lanes and public restrooms.

But thanks to Philadelphia politicians, rich folk who say their tax dollars went to the awful Paines skatepark(you know, the people who pay lower taxes because of their high income),  former mayor Michael Nutter, and a whole other bunch of worthless people. What they turned this place into has made me want to move out of Philadelphia for 5 years now. I really hope people understand how bad this was to a lot of people. Everyone stresses social issues, this is one that should be addressed. It was a place where friends of all colors and backgrounds came together to enjoy a common activity. I could rant and express more anger in this review but I want people to know, from me, who has spent 100,000+ hours skateboarding in what used to be love park, that this is a social tragedy. Personally it took a large piece of my life away for nothing. The current state of the park is dull, full of trash, and all the other undesirable things skateboarding used to regulate. But what do oblivious politicians know from their comfy offices. Nothing. They know nothing. They are nothing and I hope that one day when their time comes like everyone else, they were nothing. If any billionaire wants to put this place back together I will do all the labor myself. That would be one of the best philanthropic moves a rich person could do. Unlike charities and all that kind of donation, this would actually help people. I dare one of you billionaires to restore love park. I'm calling you all out now. I dare you. If you're not scared to actually help something for real then I dare you to do this."
